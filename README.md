## Tobacco Use and Mortality, 2004-2015
- In this repository the visualization of stats and important graphs are obtained in order to better understand the relation of tobacco use and mortality rates    and impactful graphs which can be used for advanced studies.
- This project involves using machine learning to analyze the relationship between tobacco use and mortality rates. The goal is to predict the likelihood of       mortality based on various factors related to tobacco use. Here's a detailed outline to guide you through the project:

## Objective.
- Objective: Predict the likelihood of mortality based on tobacco use patterns and related factors.
- Scope: Focus on a specific demographic or geographic region if necessary, and consider both direct and indirect factors influencing mortality
